## Sales Demand Forecasting Project

### üìã Project Overview

**Business Context**: You work as a data analyst for "TechGadget Retail", a mid-sized electronics retailer with 5 store locations. The company needs to optimize inventory management and improve sales planning by accurately predicting future sales demand.

**Objective**: Build a predictive model to forecast monthly sales demand for the next 6 months across different product categories and store locations.

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Time series analysis
- Feature engineering
- Multiple regression modeling
- Data visualization
- Business insights and recommendations

### üìù Project Tasks

#### Phase 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning (25% of time)
1. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Check for missing values, duplicates, outliers
   - Validate data types and ranges
   - Document data quality issues

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
